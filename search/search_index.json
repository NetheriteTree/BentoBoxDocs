Let's take these one by one:</p> <p>. The @StoreAt annotation before the class defines where this config file will be stored. It is relative to the data folder of the BentoBox plugin. Files should only ever be stored within the BentoBox folder. It is very important that you declare this location explicitly! . The @Comment annotation is used to add a line of comment into the YAML file. The \"[version]\" placeholder is automatically replaced with the version number of the add-on. . The class must implement both DataObject and WorldSettings. DataObject is used so the class can be saved in the database (via BBConfig) and WorldSettings is used because this is a Game Mode add-on . The field \"allowObsidianScooping\" is declared, along with a default value and it has a comment annotation and a @ConfigEntry annotation. This one is used to define where this value will be placed in the YAML file. Note that YAML entries are generally placed in the same order as they are written in the code unless the @ConfigEntry forces them to be placed elsewhere. . After the field is declared, you also need to create a getter and setter for the field. (Not shown in the code)</p> <p>Note that by implementing the WorldSetting interface, you will have to @Override a number of getters for mandatory world settings. In the BSkyBlock Settings class almost all of these are loaded from the config file. One exception is the Optional getAddon(). This must return the add-on instance. Right now, the add-on must set this. In the future, BentoBox may set it. <p>= Registering the World with BentoBox</p> <p>Now let's take a closer look at the BSkyBlockWorld class mentioned above. This class does three main things:</p> <p>. Makes the worlds for BSkyBlock (creates the worlds and defines generators for them) . Registers the main over world and the settings class with BentoBox . Registers the schems that will be used when creating new islands with the IslandCreate class</p> <p>This is how it does it:</p>"},{"location":"BentoBox/Creating-a-Game-Mode/#sourcejava_2","title":"[source,java]","text":"<p>// Create the world if it does not exist islandWorld = WorldCreator.name(worldName).type(WorldType.FLAT).environment(World.Environment.NORMAL)     .generator(new ChunkGeneratorWorld(addon)).createWorld();</p> <p>// Register the world and settings with BentoBox addon.getPlugin().registerWorld(islandWorld, addon.getSettings());</p> <p>// Make the nether and end worlds if required (not shown)</p> <p>// Load schematics addon.getPlugin().getSchemsManager().loadIslands(islandWorld);</p> <p>In this code, addon is the add-on instance. getPlugin() is used to get BentoBox and registerWorld() is used to register the world.

BentoBox will assume that any associated Nether or End are also owned by your add-on if they exist.</p> <p>For schems, (BentoBox's own proprietary schematics file format), you should have schems for the default island for each world in your add-on's schems folder.

It can only be classes that exist for all plugins. If you try to reference a hidden class, the plugin will generate an exception. So, integers, longs, Bukkit Locations, worlds, etc. are fine.</p> <p>It is good practice to document what your map will be because plugin authors will be using it:</p> <pre><code>        /*\n            What we need in the map:\n            0. \"world-name\" -&gt; String\n            1. \"player\" -&gt; UUID\n            What we will return:\n            - 0L if invalid input/player has no island\n            - the island level otherwise (which may be 0)\n         */\n</code></pre> <p>After that process the map and provide the result:</p> <pre><code>        if (map == null || map.isEmpty()\n                || map.get(\"world-name\") == null || !(map.get(\"world-name\") instanceof String)\n                || map.get(\"player\") == null || !(map.get(\"player\") instanceof UUID)\n                || Bukkit.getWorld((String) map.get(\"world-name\")) == null) {\n            return 0L;\n        }\n\n        return addon.getIslandLevel(Bukkit.getWorld((String) map.get(\"world-name\")), (UUID) map.get(\"player\"));\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Note that you are returning an <code>Object</code> so the plugin author will need to cast it to the correct form, in this case, a <code>long</code>.

Every text in the GUI will always try to use BentoBox localization. It means that if you specify a text that links to a translation, it will use it. F.e.: <pre><code>tooltip: panels.tooltips.left\n</code></pre> will try to get translation string from any of BentoBox locales: <pre><code>panels:\ntooltips:\nleft: \"Left Click Tooltip\"\n</code></pre></p> What is type? <p>In Spigot plugins you can specify 3 types of inventories, that players can interact: - <code>INVENTORY</code> - simple inventory like chests with 27 till 54 slots. - <code>HOPPER</code> - hopper inventory with 5 slots. - <code>DROPPER</code> - dropper inventory with 9 slots.</p> <p>Other inventories, like enchanting and anvil, are not supported by Spigot and requires extra plugins. That is reason why BentoBox currently do not support them.</p> What is background? <p>The background item allows setting unified item for all empty spaces that will be left in the GUI. It requires to have icon and title. If you do not want to have it, just remove <code>background</code> lines. The only required thing under <code>background</code> is icon. <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> can be removed. <pre><code>    icon: BLACK_STAINED_GLASS_PANE\ntitle: \"The title of background item\"\ndescription: \"The description of background item\"\n</code></pre></p> What is border? <p>The border item allows setting unified item all around the GUI. It will replace only empty spaced. It requires to have icon and title. If you do not want to have it, just remove <code>border</code> lines. The only required thing under <code>background</code> is icon. <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> can be removed. <pre><code>    icon: BLACK_STAINED_GLASS_PANE\ntitle: \"The title of border item\"\ndescription: \"The description of border item\"\n</code></pre></p> Can I set empty text and hide tooltip? <p>Unfortunately, Minecraft servers cannot disable text and tooltip rendering for clients. Only for modded clients (like fabric or forge) it can be done. The closest you can get is to set an empty text with: <code>&amp;b&amp;r</code></p> What is <code>force-shown</code>? <p>In inventory GUI's we try to remove all completely empty lines. This allows to set dynamic size of GUI's for different number of available elements in them. However, sometime you want always to see a specific line. Force-show option allows to do it, and you can list integers with lines (from 0-6).</p> What is reusable? <p>In some GUI's you would have a lot of repeating items that you would need to specify, like challenges or biomes. Reusable allows to create a single element that will be replaced in all places where object is required from content part.</p> How to properly fill <code>conetent</code>? <p>Content requires to specify row number (from 1 to 6) as first thing and column number for each button (from 1 to 9). It does not require to specify every slot, just the ones you want to fill. Everything else will be either empty, background or border.</p> <p>Note, that some GUI types does not have multiple rows or less columns.</p> What is <code>data</code> for buttons? <p>Data is a way how we implemented a feature for addons to use custom functions. Like Challenges addon has two type of data: CHALLENGE and LEVEL. Each addon has its own data, and it may contain more things than a type.</p> What is <code>actions</code> for buttons? <p><code>Actions</code> allows implementing different things that will happen if player use different click options on the buttons. All click options can be found here: ClickType Be aware, not all options are usable by players.</p> <p><code>action</code> supports tooltip generation. Tooltips will be always added at the end of the button description and will be in the order of actions.</p>"},{"location":"addons/Bank/","title":"Bank","text":"<p>Bank provides an island bank to enable island members to share money.</p> <p>Created and maintained by tastybento.</p> <p>Useful links</p> <ul> <li>GitHub repository (Releases)</li> <li>Issue tracker</li> <li>Development builds (Latest stable build)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"addons/Bank/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Each island has a bank account.

This addon is one of the first one which uses this functionality. We tried to be as simple as possible for customization, however, some features requires explanation. You can find more information how BentoBox custom GUI's works here: Custom GUI's</p> How can I customize GUI's <p>To customize Addon GUI's you need to have version 2.0. This is a first version that has implemented them. Addon will create a new directory under <code>/plugins/BentoBox/addons/Biomes</code> with a name <code>panels</code></p> <p>Currently you can customize 3 GUI's:</p> <ul> <li>Main Panel: <code>main_panel</code> - panel that contains all biomes that users can purchase or use them.</li> <li>Advanced Panel: <code>advanced_panel</code> - panel that contains different ways how biome can be applied on island.</li> <li>Buy Panel: <code>buy_panel</code> - panel that contains biomes which player can buy.</li> </ul> <p>Each GUI contains functions that is supported only by itself.</p> What does <code>PREVIOUS</code>|<code>NEXT</code> button type? <p>The PREVIOUS and NEXT button types allows creating automatic paging, when you have more biomes than spaces in GUI. These types have extra parameters under data:</p> <ul> <li><code>indexing</code> - indicates if button will show page number.</li> </ul> <p>Example:  <pre><code>    icon: TIPPED_ARROW:INSTANT_HEAL::::1\ntitle: biomes.gui.buttons.previous.name\ndescription: biomes.gui.buttons.previous.description\ndata:\ntype: PREVIOUS\nindexing: true\naction:\nleft:\ntooltip: biomes.gui.tips.click-to-previous\n</code></pre></p> What is <code>RETURN</code> button type? <p>This button is available in all panels. It creates a button that allows to return to previous menu or exit the gui. Description is generated by addon, however, like with all buttons, you can specify your own text in panel.</p> <p>Example:  <pre><code>    data:\ntype: RETURN\n</code></pre></p> What is <code>BIOME</code> button type? <p>This button is available in main_panel and buy_panel. The BIOME button creates a dynamic entry for a biomes object. Button will be filled only if there exist a biome. F.e. if you have only 3 biomes, but defined 7 spots for them in the GUI, then only 3 spots will be filled. Other spots will be left empty.</p> <p>By default biomes will be ordered by their order numbers, however, you can specify a specific biome to be in a specific slot with <code>id</code> parameter under data.</p> <pre><code>  data:\ntype: BIOME\nid: example_biome\n</code></pre> <p>Specifying title, description and icon will overwrite dynammic generation based on database data. By default these values will be generated from database entries. This button supports 3 different action types:</p> <ul> <li>CHANGE - changes biome based on default update mode and default range values.

If we use your example of making each level 50% harder to reach than the previous level, then the approximate formula for that is:</p> <p><code>level-calc: 2.4661 * log(blocks) - (2.4661 * log(level_cost) - 1)</code></p> <p>where <code>level_cost</code> is the cost in blocks to get to level 1. e.g., if level 1 costs 100 blocks, the level 2 costs 150 blocks, level 3 costs 225, etc.</p> <p>Here's the graph:</p> <p></p> <p>Note that that particular formula does start to asymptote around level 25, i.e., it becomes really hard to get to level 26 or 27 because so many blocks are required, so having that particular rule might not be that good an approach because eventually almost everyone will end up with the same level.</p> <p>Anyway, although I understand what you're asking, the <code>level-calc</code> formula should actually be able to provide what you want so long as it supports the right formula. Having the <code>next-levelcost</code> is problematic from a programming standpoint because the level calculations would have to be done iteratively instead of by just applying a single formula to the blocks counted. I can't quite work out how to do that right now but I do know that the current method of having a formula for how you want levels increased does work for sure.</p> <p>How can I work out a formula for levels?</p> <p>The best way is to start with a formula and plot it to see if it makes sense, e.g., by using something like Excel. If you want to work out what formula you need from say a table of values, then Excel (or maybe some other spreadsheet) can do that too: make a graph of levels and how many blocks for each level and then plot a graph of the table (X Y Plot). Right click the graph to add a trend line, select the approximation, e.g., linear, log, exponential, etc. that best fits, and then select \"Display equation on chart\" to display the formula and substitute <code>blocks</code> for <code>x</code>. Here's some screenshots of what I did you find out the equation for increasing by 50% each time with a starting cost of 100 blocks.</p> <p> </p> <p>So, for that, it would be:</p> <p><code>level-calc: 2.4661 * log(blocks) - 10.357</code></p> <p>I hope that helps.</p>"},{"location":"addons/Level/#translations","title":"Translations","text":"<p>We need your help!</p> <p>A vast majority of strings in BentoBox and its addons can be translated into virtually any language.

Fill a chest with the contents you want and then while looking at it enter the command <code>/[admin_cmd] setchest &lt;phase&gt; &lt;rarity&gt;</code> where  is the name of the phase and rarity is the rarity. Use Tab Complete to see the options. The chest will be automatically added to the oneblocks.yml file and be ready to use.

You need to build defenses.</p> Why do certain blocks spawn more frequently than others? <p>They just do! You can set the relative probability in the config files in the phases folder.</p> How do I know which is the magic block? <p>Hit it and it will give out green particles.</p> My magic block is no longer there! How do I get another one? <p>You will have to place a block there. Worse case, kill yourself and one will be generated.</p> My magic block is liquid! How can I mine it? <p>Use a bucket.</p> Which mobs can spawn? <p>Each phase has a different set of mobs that can spawn. Be careful because they may push you off! If you listen carefully, you may hear hostile mobs coming.</p> I have no chance to react to hostile mobs spawning! <p>Be prepared. Listen carefully when you mine a block and you will hear hostile mobs coming before they spawn. If you are in a hostile phase, then expect mobs and build defenses to protect yourself. You can mine a block from quite far away.</p> When mobs spawn, my defenses are destroyed! Why? <p>Mobs make space to spawn. If there's anything in the way, it'll be broken and dropped. You'll have to build accordingly.</p> Do chests spawn? <p>Yes. Chests spawn with random items in them from the current phase. There are common, uncommon, rare and epic chests. Chests with sparkles are good.</p> Is it possible to reach the Nether or End in this map? <p>The vanilla Nether exists by default but there is no End world.</p> <p>However, BentoBox is customizable, and you can enable nether islands and end world in AOneBlock config file.</p> <p>Be aware, magic block is located only in overworld.</p> What is the end goal? <p>It's whatever you want it to be! </p> How to use holograms? <p>AOneBlock uses Holographic Displays for holograms if you use 1.12.3 and below. You need to install this plugin to use holograms sections!</p> <p>However, since 1.13 version and Minecraft 1.19.4, you do not need any extra plugins for holograms. They will be displayed using Minecraft Text Entity.</p> Should I use the Levels addon? <p>It's up to you, but if you do be aware that levels could get high because players have an infinite block.  I prefer not to use it and instead use the Likes addon.</p>"},{"location":"gamemodes/AOneBlock/#translations","title":"Translations","text":"<p>We need your help!</p> <p>A vast majority of strings in BentoBox and its addons can be translated into virtually any language.

That is something we have little control on as a plugin, but here are a few things you could do to mitigate this:</p> <ul> <li>Try reducing the \"distance between islands\" setting in the gamemode's config file. Lower values means fewer chunks to generate. This will require you to entirely reset the worlds and databases.</li> <li>Use Paper as your server software.

Also, if the why command says that a player can do something but in-game they cannot, then that indicates another plugin (or the server itself) is preventing the action.</p>"},{"location":"en/BentoBox/About/Protections/#protections","title":"Protections","text":"<ul> <li>Breaking and Placing Blocks</li> <li>Block Interaction</li> <li>Containers</li> <li>Anvils</li> <li>Buttons</li> <li>Beds</li> <li>Doors and trap doors</li> <li>Beacons</li> <li>Brewing stands</li> <li>Cauldrons</li> <li>Barrels</li> <li>Beehives</li> <li>Bee nests</li> <li>Composters</li> <li>Furnaces, smokers, and campfires</li> <li>Enchanting tables</li> <li>Jukeboxes and note blocks</li> <li>Crafting tables</li> <li>Levers</li> <li>Redstone-related blocks</li> <li>Dragon Eggs</li> <li>Item Frames</li> <li>Berry picking</li> <li>Cake eating</li> <li>Gate usage</li> <li>Breeding</li> <li>Bucket use</li> <li>Dye use</li> <li>Egg use</li> <li>Elytra use</li> <li>Interaction with:</li> <li>Vehicles, including boats, minecrarts and ridable animals like horses, etc.</li> <li>Villager trading</li> <li>Name tag protection</li> <li>Item or experience pickup or item dropping</li> <li>Fire-related: prevention of ignition, spreading, burning, lightning-related, etc.</li> <li>Damaging or hurting monsters or animals</li> <li>Leash use</li> <li>Lectern use</li> <li>Physical interactions</li> <li>Portal use</li> <li>Sheering</li> <li>Teleportation, e.g., using chorus fruit or ender pearls</li> <li>Throwing of items, including potions</li> <li>TNT or other explosion protections</li> </ul>"},{"location":"en/BentoBox/About/Protections/#island-settings","title":"Island Settings","text":"<p>These are settings that an owner can change for their island.

Players may be able to view them as well in a read-only mode. This may help players understand what type of server they are playing on and what is allowed or not.</p> <ul> <li>Chest explosion damage - this protects chests from being damaged by explosions. Explosions could be due to Creepers, TNT cannons, Wither or Ghast explosions, etc. The default is to prevent chests from being broken. Although this provides good protection for players, it does provide a somewhat exploitable system whereby indestructible rooms can be made with chests, e.g., to hold a Wither. Admins should consider the tradeoff.</li> <li>Cleaning up a super-flat world - in rare situations, the world generation of a BentoBox world may not be running or malfunction. As most BentoBox worlds are officially \"super-flat\" worlds according to the server, new world chunks will be created as super-flat chunks. These are a few layers of blocks starting at y=0 and covered in grass. Admins can recover from a world where super-flat chunks exist by switching this setting on. It will detect super-flat chunks and try to convert them to the game mode's chunk type, e.g. void. This process can lag the server so it should not be left on unless it is required. Recovered chunks are reported in the console log.</li> <li>Coarse Dirt Tilling Prevention - this setting is to prevent players from making dirt out of coarse dirt. In a number of BentoBox game modes, dirt is highly prized because it cannot be crafted, but it can be used to grow crops, feed sheep, etc. The Level addon will score dirt blocks higher than other blocks for this reason. Dirt is rare and given out sparingly. Coarse dirt enables dirt to be created by mixing it with gravel. If the Game Mode allows players to obtain gravel easily, e.g., via the vanilla Nether world, then coarse dirt making can be exploited to make dirt. The default setting is to disallow coarse dirt tilling, but it can probably be allowed so long as gravel is not too readily available.</li> <li>Creeper protection - Creepers explode and BentoBox provides a few ways to handle them<ul> <li>Prevent damage from the explosion - this will switch off the explosive damage of a creeper. Creepers are the number one way that an island can be destroyed and admins may not want to deal with players crying about their island being blown up. However, preventing this makes the game a lot easier.</li> <li>Prevent visitors from lighting creepers on other islands - this is a type of griefing where a visitor can use flint &amp; steel to prime a creeper and make it explode with the purpose of getting access to parts of another island, or just for fun. BentoBox is able to identify whether the player is a visitor or not and prevent this action.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Ender Chests - access and crafting of Ender Chests are prevented by default because they provide a method for players to obtain items from other worlds. If the admin has a per-world Ender Chest plugin, then this setting can be switched off.</li> <li>Enderman protection - Endermen will randomly pick up blocks from islands. BentoBox. As this can lead to players complaining to admins about missing blocks, there is a setting to prevent this.</li> <li>Geo-Limiting of mobs - Some mobs, especially flying mobs can be spawned on one island and then potentially move outside of that island and enter other player's islands. For destructive mobs like the Wither, this is undesirable. This setting prevents the specified mobs from exiting the island. If they do, they are removed from the game.</li> <li>Visitor Protection - part of the fun of a multi-player game is having other players visit your island and see all the hard work you have done. However, some players see visitors as prey and try to develop ways to kill or harm them. BentoBox by default protects visitors from most harm. All types of Minecraft damage can be switched off. If a visitor falls into the void, they can be teleported to safety. Admins can configure what type of damage is prevented via the admin settings menu.</li> <li>Item frame protection - these have their own protection because they can be used in a variety of ways. The default is to protect them from being damaged and dropping the item in them. </li> <li>Global mob spawning limitations - admins can use this setting to decide which mob types can spawn in the world. For example, Phantoms can be switched off. This setting overrides any other settings or spawning mechanisms, e.g. spawn eggs or spawner blocks.</li> <li>Liquid management - players can abuse the ability of liquids to flow outside of their protection zone and cause blocks to form, e.g., by letting lava and water mingle to make cobblestone. This setting stops the liquids from flowing.</li> <li>Natual Mob Spawning Outside Of Islands - this setting can prevent mobs from spawning outside of island boundaries. This can help concentrate mob spawning to be within islands. For worlds like AcidIsland, this is not recommended because it appears unnatural.</li> <li>Obsidian scooping - one classic newbie mistake on SkyBlock is to turn your one bucket of lava into obsidian by accidentally having it touch water in the wrong way. This is very common when players make a cobblestone generator and get it wrong. This setting by default enables a \"cheat\" that enables the player to use a bucket on a block of obsidian to return it to lava. This helps prevent players from reseting their island or bothering the admin for more lava. BentoBox checks that the obsidian block is a single block and that there are no other obsidian blocks close to it (+/- 2 blocks) before allowing the scooping. This limits exploitation of this cheat.</li> <li>Offline Growth Management - in general, plants will not grow on a BentoBox island unless the chunk is loaded on the server. Therefore, when players are offline, the plants do not usually grow. However, as visitors may visit an island and cause the chunks to be loaded, the plants can grow and mature. If players are complaining about this edge case, maybe because they have a Redstone machine that handles harvesting, then plant growth can be switched off when island members are not present.</li> <li>Offline Redstone Management - similar to the plant growth option, it may be desirable to disable all Redstone operations when team members are not present. This enables that to happen.</li> <li>Piston management - pistons can be used to create self-powered machines that fly through the air and invade other player's islands. This prevents pistons from operating (pushing) if they are outside the island's protection area. The default is for this prevention to be active because it is a favorite exploit of players.</li> <li>Remove mobs on teleport - this setting will clear the area of any hostile mobs when a player teleports. Admins can adjust what mobs will not be removed via the game mode's <code>config.yml</code> file. This feature helps prevent instant or surprise deaths due to a player teleporting to their home. The default is on.</li> <li>Spawner block protection - For some reason, spawner blocks are often given to SkyBlock players by admins, either as a reward or as a result of a purchase. However, spawner blocks have a vanilla function that enables the mob to be spawned to be changed by a player tapping it with a spawn egg. This prevents that function so that spawner blocks stay the same time. BentoBox also prevents the use of the <code>/spawner</code> or related commands by visitors to an island that can be used to change the type of spawner.</li> <li>Tree growth handling - This prevents trees from growing outside the island's protection range. If trees can do that, it can enable players to intrude into adjacent islands or result in blocks that they cannot access. </li> <li>Wither protection - the Wither has the ability to destroy so much so this flag enables admins to limit the damage the Wither can do.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"en/BentoBox/About/Teams/","title":"Teams","text":"<p>BentoBox manages teams for game modes.
